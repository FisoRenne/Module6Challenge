## Description:
Project using 2 OpenWaether API's: One for the current weather, and one for the five day forecast. 
When a specific city is searched, the current and five day forecast is produced which includes the temp, humidity, wind, and an icon to represent the weather. 
When a city is searched the name is then saved to the recent searches. It should be clickable to where when it clicked the information is once again produced, but currently does not work.
